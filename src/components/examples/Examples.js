        calculate the taxes. With exemptions or without exemptions. Let's say
        you have an annual total compensation = 873000. This includes all
        allowances, incentives etc. With exemptions: This total compensation
        will not be taxable by default. You can add exemptions, deductions to
        find out your actual salary on which tax is applied. Exemptions:
        If you are paying house rent you can request for exemption of some
